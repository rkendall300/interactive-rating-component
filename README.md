## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The most important part of this project was getting the states to work across multiple pages. In a previous project, I split the pages into separate files and linked them through imports, but this time I wanted to try and do everything in one file since it wouldn't be too large or confusing to handle. I will probably continue to put everything in one file until I have a lot of components working together.

Of course, thanks to my friend Eric for all the help with frontend development so far! Hopefully I will continue to pump out these solutions and maybe teach him something instead.
